# D&D Spell Finder :mage: + :detective:

## About :mega:

Tired of flipping through your book to find details on a specific spell for your D&D character? Use this website ([dnd-spells.mg3.codes](https://dnd-spells.mg3.codes)) to search, filter, and export spells as spreadsheets or cards.

## Building :bricks:

1. Install [yarn modern](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
1. Clone code
1. Run `yarn` in project root
1. Run `yarn dev` to start development server

## Running Tests :microscope:

Tests are run using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). It is recommended that you run the tests before opening a pull request. They will run automatically when a pull request is opened and are required to pass before merging.

The tests are run against the Chrome browser. It is recommended that you also run them against chrome.

1. Open two terminals
1. In one terminal run `yarn build-test && yarn preview`
1. In the other terminal run `yarn cypress open` to run the tests using the GUI or run `yarn cypress run --browser chrome` to run without the GUI.
